Start your weekends off right with Friday Night Flicks: A Drive-In Movie Experience, presented by Vancouver Parks and Recreation. The six-week series will show a new family-friendly film every Friday night from Aug. 28 to Oct. 2.

Friday Night Flicks drive-in movie screenings are spread out over three Vancouver locations. Gates open at 8 p.m., the big screen comes to life at 9 p.m. Cost per vehicle is $20 for Vancouver residents and $23 for non-residents. Tickets must be purchased in advance at www.cityofvancouver.us/movies. Audio will be accessible via FM radio signal.

Each location is set up to ensure proper physical distancing between vehicles. Attendees must follow physical distancing guidelines and wear face coverings if they need to leave their vehicle during the movie.  Staff and volunteers are trained in COVID-19 health and safety protocols and will wear face coverings at all times.

“Gathering people at special events is one of our favorite things to do during the summer, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced us to cancel those plans for this year,” said Vancouver Parks and Recreation Special Events Manager Stacey Donovan. “We are excited to be able to offer a new entertainment option that safely gets people out in the community again.”
